# HelloWorld
This is my first personal repository. <br />

## My Career Interests
I currently work in Healthcare IT, developing Medical Logic Modules and am hoping to get further involved with Software development.  I've been working on refining skills with Java, Github, C, Python and hope to be a full stack developer.  


## My Hobbies
My passion has always been gaming since an early age but I have many other hobbies as well.  I enjoy board games, golf, tennis, bowling, escape rooms, traveling, fine dining, and much more.

## My favorite books
Homeland by R.A. Salvatore, Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, Ready Player One by Ernest Cline, and Scythe by Neal Shusterman.
